This generates images of a few varieties of static.  I recently took particular notice of how, when you look at static or paint splatters or carpet or whatever, your brain can pick out images.  I wanted a source of static so I could draw over it.  Worked quite well!

Note that this uses my ImagePanel from MathNStuff.
